# Data Analyst Porject: Visualizing and Analyzing Dataset Using Power BI and SQL

This repository showcases a Data Analyst project that involves exploring, visualizing, and analyzing a dataset using Power BI for data visualization and SQL for querying and data manipulation. The project aims to demonstrate skills in data analysis, visualization, and SQL query proficiency.

## Introduction
I have undertaken a project to showcase my abilities in handling real-world data, performing data analysis, creating insightful visualizations, and effectively using SQL for querying and manipulation tasks. This project is a testament to my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, as well as my SQL skills.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the internet and pertains to a specific domain or topic of interest. It includes relevant attributes that allow for exploration, analysis, and visualization. The dataset is an integral component of this project, serving as the foundation for all analytical and visual components.

## Resource Used
- **Power BI**
- **SQL**

## Overview
- **Data Exploration**: The dataset was carefully examined to understand its structure, features, and potential insights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning steps were undertaken to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations were created using Power BI to highlight trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries were crafted to perform advanced data manipulations, calculations, and aggregations.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Interactive and insightful dashboards were developed in Power BI to effectively communicate findings.

## Steps
- **Data Acquisition**: The dataset was obtained from an online source, ensuring its relevance to the project's objectives.
- **Data Preparation**: Initial data exploration and data cleaning were performed to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Power BI Visualization**: Interactive visualizations, charts, and dashboards were created using Power BI to showcase insights.
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries were designed to extract specific information, perform calculations, and answer analytical questions.
- **Integration**: Insights from SQL queries were incorporated into Power BI visualizations to provide a comprehensive view.
- **Documentation**: The process, findings, and insights were documented for clear communication.

## Result
The project culminated in a set of interactive Power BI dashboards that effectively visualize key insights from the dataset. These visualizations highlight trends, correlations, and patterns that contribute to a better understanding of the data. Additionally, SQL queries showcase my ability to extract targeted information from the dataset using structured query language.
